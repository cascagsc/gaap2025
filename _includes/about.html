            GAAP (Guide to Applying for Astronomy Postdocs) is a series of online workshops  
            designed for prospective postdocs in astronomy. 
            The initiative aims to support emerging astronomers who are looking to transition, 
            or bridge the gap,  
            from graduate studies to 
            postdoctoral research positions, as well as from one postdoctoral position to another. 
            The series is jointly organized by the <a href="https://casca.ca/?page_id=279" target="_blank">Graduate Student Committee (GSC)</a> 
            and the <a href="https://casca.ca/?page_id=14828" target="_blank">Postdoctoral Committee (PDC)</a> of the 
            <a href="https://casca.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian Astronomical Society / Société Canadienne d'Astronomie (CASCA)</a>.

            The GAAP workshop sessions will provide helpful information and experiential insights 
            about the process of applying for postdoctoral positions and fellowships. 
            The events will also serve as a platform for discussions and opportunity for applicants 
            to forge supportive connections with other applicants. 
            We invite participation from students or recent graduates engaged 
            in astronomy research who are interested in pursing postdoctoral research opportunities,   
            particularly senior graduate students in Canada.
